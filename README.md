# Hi there, I'm Tushar! ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)


I'm a **Software Architect** with over 13 years of experience in architecting and developing high-performance, scalable, and cloud-native solutions. I’m passionate about transforming business challenges into actionable, innovative, and efficient software solutions. I thrive in the world of **cloud computing**, **microservices**, and **serverless architectures**, and I’m always looking for new ways to optimize and improve the way we build software.

## 🚀 What I Do
I specialize in architecting **multi-tenant, scalable SaaS platforms**, leveraging the power of **AWS services** like Lambda, S3, RDS, and ECS. Whether it’s designing fault-tolerant architectures or optimizing APIs for performance, I focus on building robust, high-performance solutions that drive business success.

I’m skilled in **.NET/C#**, **Java**, **Node.js**, **Angular**, **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, and **PostgreSQL**, and I have a deep understanding of modern **cloud architectures** and **DevOps practices**. From **microservices** to **Event-Driven Architectures**, my work is centered around creating systems that are scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain.

## 🌱 Current Projects
Right now, I’m working on several exciting cloud-native projects that focus on **application modernization** and **cloud optimization**. I’m particularly interested in **performance tuning**, **cloud governance**, and **cost management** to help businesses optimize their cloud resources and reduce operational costs.

I’m also working on optimizing **CI/CD pipelines** and **DevOps workflows**, reducing build times, and increasing deployment efficiency. Additionally, I’m building solutions that emphasize **security** and **monitoring**, ensuring that my projects not only perform well but are also secure and compliant.

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!
I believe that collaboration is key to building great software. I'm always open to **contributing** to open-source projects, **mentoring** developers, and working with others who share a passion for creating innovative solutions. Whether you're interested in discussing cloud architecture, microservices design, or just sharing insights on tech, I’d love to connect!

## 🧠 A Little About Me
Outside of coding, I enjoy **mentoring**, **problem-solving**, and **strategizing** on how we can build the next generation of software. I’m always looking for new ways to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. If you’re passionate about **cloud computing**, **scalability**, and **software architecture**, we’ll likely get along really well!
